# CCC-Solutions

### Description

A simple repository to house CCC solutions in both **C++ and Python** for myself and anyone else in the developer community that are interested. 

### What is the CCC?

The Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) is a programming competition that runs annually and challenges high-school students to engage in programming problems. The CCC consists of two levels: **Junior** and **Senior**, with the Senior level consisting of IOI level problems. Each level consists of 5 problems and each problem increases in difficulty from the previous level.

### How this repository is organized

1. Junior levels (Each problem is finished usually in Python since most don't require more time-intensive algorithms like **recursion** and therefore, don't require C++ to reduce time)
2. Senior levels (S1 and S2 are often finished in Python and C++, while problems involving S3 and above are always done in C++ simply to save time and increase run-time speed. Some files are labeled as **brute force algorithms**, meaning that they do not involve intelligent selection and always follow through with the brute-force method, while the proper answers are not labeled so and thus, finish the task in less time.

### Contributing Guidelines

Contributors are always welcome! If you'd like to add more solutions to this repository just **clone** this repo and submit a [pull request]. Thanks for being interested in CCC Solutions!
