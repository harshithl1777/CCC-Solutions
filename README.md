# CCC-Solutions

### Description

A simple repository to house CCC solutions in both **C++ and Python** for myself and anyone else in the developer community that are interested. 

### What is the CCC?

The Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) is a programming competition that runs annually and challenges high-school students to engage in programming problems. The CCC consists of two levels: **Junior** and **Senior**, with the Senior level consisting of IOI level problems. Each level consists of 5 problems and each problem increases in difficulty from the previous level.

### How this repository is organized

..* Junior levels
.....* Each problem is finished usually in Python since most don't require more time-intensive algorithms like **recursion** and therefore, don't require C++ to reduce time
